## Introduction

Palindromes are fascinating. They appear in various languages and contexts. This project aims to provide tools to identify, generate, and manipulate palindromes easily. Whether you're a developer looking to integrate palindrome checks into your application or a language enthusiast, this repository offers the resources you need.

## Features

- **Palindrome Checker**: Quickly check if a given string is a palindrome.
- **Palindrome Generator**: Generate palindromic sequences based on user-defined parameters.
- **Statistics**: Get detailed statistics about palindromic sequences, including lengths and variations.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple command-line interface for ease of use.

## Installation

To get started with Palidrome, you need to clone the repository to your local machine. You can do this using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZoheirRah/palidrome.git
```

Next, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd palidrome
```

You can then install the required dependencies. If you're using Python, you might run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

After installing, you can run the palindrome checker with the following command:

```bash
python palindrome_checker.py "your_string_here"
```

Replace `"your_string_here"` with the string you want to check. The output will indicate whether the string is a palindrome.

To generate palindromes, use:

```bash
python palindrome_generator.py --length 5
```

This command will generate palindromic sequences of the specified length.
